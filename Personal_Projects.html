								<h3>Global Electronics Retailer: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis</h3>
								<p>Global Electronics is a local retail store based in the United States that specializes in sales of all electronic products. <br />
								In this task, I developed an ETL process for cleaning the data and carrying out an Exploratory analysis on SQL, and used Power BI for visualization. <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjhhZTVhYzItMTBiOS00Y2NhLTkzYmEtMDI3OWU5YzkxNWNmIiwidCI6IjEzNzBhYTVmLTZiMTUtNDU1OS1iYzNkLTFjNzE5ZmNmZTVkOSJ9">Go to Dashboard.</a> This was done to remove discrepancies in the data and to provide detailed insights into business requirements.<br />
								Further detail into the task is available in my <a href="https://medium.com/@damoladeagbo/data-cleaning-and-exploratory-analysis-of-a-global-electronics-retailer-using-mysql-power-bi-91cb82ab920d">Medium article</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Dedamola1/Global-Retail-Analysis/blob/main/Global_Retail_Analysis.sql">GitHub.</a> 
								</p>
								<p>
								Key Insights uncovered are: <br/>
								1. Top performing category were the computer sales with $18.6 million in total revenue, accounting for 34.6% of the total revenue. <br />
								2. Most purchases were customers who were residents of United States, having 53.7% of the total orders. <br/>
								3. 79.3% of the revenue was generated from in-store sales. <br/>
								4. North America was the region with the highest demand for electronics with over 123,000 orders. <br/>

								<h3>Northwind Sales: Data Extraction</h3>
								<p>The Northwind database is a sample database used by Microsoft to demonstrate the features of some of its products, including SQL Server and Microsoft Access. 
								The aim of this project was to create a centralized system for data management, implement and ETL process for streamlining the data collection and analysis process (Data Cleaning and Extraction), and visualize the outcome (Business Requirements) using Tableau.
								Full detail of the task is in this <a href="https://medium.com/@damoladeagbo/unraveling-the-popular-northwind-dataset-using-sql-tableau-aaa02fafd1fd"> Medium article</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Dedamola1/Northwind-Analysis/blob/main/Northwind%20Sales%20Analysis.sql">Github.</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									The implementation of the automated ETL process significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of Northwind's data analysis. Data retrieval times were reduced by approximately 40%, and data accuracy increased by approximately 30%.
									As a result, the company saw a 20% increase in sales forecasting accuracy, leading to improved inventory management and reduced stockouts.
